If that works, and it mostly does (bug stories ahead), why bother making a framework?

Well, the short answer is that so I can make more than one text adventure game. As much as I love working on my Harry Potter game, it's not inconceivable that sooner or later I'd want to make another text adventure game. While I could, with my text adventure game code, create a map of new Rooms with new Things and new Players for, say, the Firefly 'verse, I wouldn't be able to reuse any of my logic code, which would try to turn lights on if the player user types "lumos". In order to be able to write more than one text adventure, I need to have a system that not only will allow me to use or not use stateful things like Filch's Office, but also will allow me to use or not use logic such as when to release the Sword of Gryffindor.

I promised some bug stories in the abstract, and you've been very good listening to me go on about state and logic and parsers for a bit, so let's take a detour and talk about the Sword of Gryffindor.

Most text adventures have a command called "examine", which returns a detailed description of, well, the thing you're examining. If you examine, say, the sorting hat, you'd expect a comment describing the hat's appearance. But, in the Harry Potter universe, the sorting hat, when examined by a member of Gryffindor house, will release the Sword of Gryffindor.

So I added some logic to the function `examine` that checks if the thing being examined is the sorting hat and if the player is a Gryffindor. If both of those checks are true, than I change the output of examine to include a line about the sword, and as a side effect add the sword to the player's inventory. This implementation results in a lot of complexity being added to an otherwise simple function for the sake of an edge case. There's a surprise state change, and to cap it all off, it doesn't work.

Imagine that your house happens to be Gryffindor, so you can release the sword from the hat. You examine the hat, get the Sword of Gryffindor, examine the hat again, get another the Sword of Gryffindor... Either there's an arbitrary number of Godric Gryffindors in the world, all of whom have swords and are involved with the education of British teenagers, or something's wrong here. The solution that I hit on was checking to see if the sword existed in the game somewhere, and only dropping the sword from the hat if the sword wasn't already in the game. This is a solution to the problem. But it's a bad solution, partly because complex if-statement-ridden code is dirty code, and partly because the UX for the game developer is terrible. If I want to write another text adventure, my `examine` command has to be completely rewritten. The experience that I, as a gamemaker want, is the freedom to write game-specific state and rules for changing state without having to rewrite code that will be common to all text adventures.

In short, if a gamemaker is writing a Harry Potter-themed text adventure game, they should be writing Harry Potter things and not text adventure game things. 
That's what I mean by a text adventure framework--a program that lets me write other programs.
