Customizable commands can also be used to make things happen at scheduled times in your game! I made the logic handler optionally have a set of commands that it runs after dealing with user input, so you can add commands with rules that allow game state to change once the player has progressed far enough in the game. For example, maybe you want to release the basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets after 100 turns. You'd need a function that, well, releases the basilisk, and a function that return True on the 100th turn. Then just add `basilisk` to the commands that are run after every turn, and you're set for castle-wide petrification!

Similarly, you could decide to sort people after a particular turn. Assuming you have a reasonable algorithm for sorting players based on their move history, you could just add schedule the algorithm to run on a player after a particular number of turns. Sorting is particularly exciting because the house attribute that gets set on the player can impact them at other points in the game (*cough* Sword of Gryffindor).

Furthermore, it turns out that customizable commands make spells a lot easier to write. For example, you can implement spells just like any other command, but with a rule that ensures that the player is carrying a wand.

Finally, you can force players to practice spells before they can actually perform them! Imagine that you increment an attribute on the Player every time they (try to) cast a spell. You can add a rule that will not allow the spell's state change to happen unless the Player has practiced a particular number of times.
